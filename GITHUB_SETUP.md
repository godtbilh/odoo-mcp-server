# 🚀 GitHub Setup Guide

Your Odoo MCP Server is now safely backed up in Git! Here's how to push it to GitHub:

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Working code committed (commit: a1e3ba1)
- ✅ GitHub README added (commit: 7539203)
- ✅ Credentials safely excluded (.env file ignored)

## 🔗 Create GitHub Repository

### Option 1: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Sign in** to your account (or create one if needed)
3. **Click "New repository"** (green button or + icon)
4. **Repository settings**:
   - Repository name: `odoo-mcp-server`
   - Description: `MCP server for Odoo integration with AI assistants`
   - Visibility: Choose **Public** or **Private**
   - ❌ **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
   - ❌ **DO NOT** add license (optional for later)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first if not installed
# Then run:
gh repo create odoo-mcp-server --public --description "MCP server for Odoo integration"
```

## 📤 Push to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with commands. Use these:

### Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/odoo-mcp-server.git
```

### Push Your Code
```bash
# Push your commits to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

If prompted for credentials:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with `repo` permissions
3. Use your username and the token as password

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
gh auth login
```

## ✅ Verification

After pushing, verify on GitHub:
1. Go to your repository URL
2. Check that all files are there (except .env)
3. Verify README displays properly
4. Confirm commit history shows both commits

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once on GitHub, you can:
- ✅ **Share** the repository with others
- ✅ **Clone** it on other machines
- ✅ **Collaborate** with team members
- ✅ **Track issues** and feature requests
- ✅ **Create releases** for stable versions

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

For future changes:
```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Repository already exists"
- Choose a different name or delete the existing repository

### "Authentication failed"
- Use personal access token instead of password
- Or use `gh auth login` with GitHub CLI

### "Permission denied"
- Check repository name and username are correct
- Verify you have push permissions

## 🎉 Success!

Once pushed to GitHub, your Odoo MCP Server will be:
- ✅ **Safely backed up** in the cloud
- ✅ **Version controlled** with full history
- ✅ **Shareable** with others
- ✅ **Professional** with proper documentation

**Your working code is now protected and ready for development!**
